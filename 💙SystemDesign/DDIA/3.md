LST - tree (log structured merge tree):
- SStable (sorted string table, on disk), unique key in sorted order
- MMTable (ordered map, in memory), Write ahead log to maintain durability
- Bloom filter: read efficiency

B-tree:
- Write Ahead log (WAL) to avoid half writing, redo after crash


Comparision:
LSM
pros: higher write throughput
cons: read less predictable, no lock/ACID

NoSQL DB support partial ACID (atomic operatoion):
- MongoDB:  on document level
- Cassandra: on row level
- Riak: opertion level

distributed relationalDB:
- google spanner (RDMS, Paxos, global time synchronization)
- cockroachDB (key-value, transactional, "resolved" to avoid latter write using timestamp, TTL (time-to-live) )
- Amazon Aurora


Crash recoery: snapshot are saved to disk and reload
Append-only log:  sequential write operations

We used Uberâ€™s open source geohashing library called H3.

For handling typeahead search, we decided to use sorted sets. This gives a set of benefits:

In-memory storage gives us the best possible latency characteristics for handling typeahead search.
It is easy to maintain. We can rely on redis persistence without having to handle durability ourselves.
By following the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern, we are able to index hundreds of millions of entities in a matter of hours with no impact to the serving of production traffic. Ingestion is handled by redis primary nodes in the cluster, and updates are then replicated to the read-only nodes which handle the typeahead search. Replication lag is less than 10ms.

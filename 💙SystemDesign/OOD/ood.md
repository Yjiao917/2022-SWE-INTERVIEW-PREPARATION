## Decorator

Log method calls that would normally work silently
Perform extra setup or cleanup around a method
Pre-process method arguments
Post-process return values
Forbid actions that the wrapped object would normally allow

```py
class Decorator(Component):
    """
    The base Decorator class follows the same interface as the other components.
    The primary purpose of this class is to define the wrapping interface for
    all concrete decorators. The default implementation of the wrapping code
    might include a field for storing a wrapped component and the means to
    initialize it.
    """

    _component: Component = None

    def __init__(self, component: Component) -> None:
        self._component = component

    @property
    def component(self) -> Component:
        """
        The Decorator delegates all work to the wrapped component.
        """

    def operation(self) -> str:

    """
    Concrete Decorators call the wrapped object and alter its result in some
    way.
    """

    def operation(self) -> str:
        """
        Decorators may call parent implementation of the operation, instead of
        calling the wrapped object directly. This approach simplifies extension
        of decorator classes.
        """
        return f"ConcreteDecoratorA({self.component.operation()})"


class ConcreteDecoratorB(Decorator):
    """
    Decorators can execute their behavior either before or after the call to a
    wrapped object.
    """

        return f"ConcreteDecoratorB({self.component.operation()})"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simple = ConcreteComponent()
  
    decorator1 = ConcreteDecoratorA(simple)
    decorator2 = ConcreteDecoratorB(decorator1)

```


## Observer pattern
notify other component with attached observer


```py
class ConcreteSubject(Subject):
    """
    The Subject owns some important state and notifies observers when the state
    changes.
    """

    _state: int = None
    """
    For the sake of simplicity, the Subject's state, essential to all
    subscribers, is stored in this variable.
    """

    _observers: List[Observer] = []
    """
    List of subscribers. In real life, the list of subscribers can be stored
    more comprehensively (categorized by event type, etc.).
    """

    def attach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        print("Subject: Attached an observer.")
        self._observers.append(observer)

    def detach(self, observer: Observer) -> None:
        self._observers.remove(observer)

    """
    The subscription management methods.
    """

    def notify(self) -> None:
        """
        Trigger an update in each subscriber.
        """

        print("Subject: Notifying observers...")
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(self)

    def some_business_logic(self) -> None:
        """
        Usually, the subscription logic is only a fraction of what a Subject can
        really do. Subjects commonly hold some important business logic, that
        triggers a notification method whenever something important is about to
        happen (or after it).
        """

        self.notify()


class Observer(ABC):
    """
    The Observer interface declares the update method, used by subjects.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, subject: Subject) -> None:
        """
        Receive update from subject.
        """
        pass


"""
Concrete Observers react to the updates issued by the Subject they had been
attached to.
"""


class ConcreteObserverA(Observer):
    def update(self, subject: Subject) -> None:
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The client code.

    subject = ConcreteSubject()

    observer_a = ConcreteObserverA()
    subject.attach(observer_a)

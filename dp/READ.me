steps:

1. initialize and sort (greedy)

2. loop through possible answers
    1) get eligible value 
    - check with result (prune if already not in answer boundary, e.g: min, max step )
    - check if arrangement is duplicated (prune since order does not matter, e.g: sum of worker)
    2) append possible answer
    3) dfs
    4) remove possible answer 
    5) add new branch

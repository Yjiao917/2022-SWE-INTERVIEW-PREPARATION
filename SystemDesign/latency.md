## optimize the latency

1\ server level

- CDN
Using CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a major step towards reducing the latency. CDN, caches content, serves it from the nearest data centre & provides an efficient path for data packets to travel on, which drastically reduces the round trip time and so latency.

- HTTP/2
HTTP/2 is a highly efficient protocol which reduces the latency by enabling parallelised data transfers, response multiplexing, requests prioritisation, minimised protocol overhead by efficient compression of HTTP headers, reduced round trips and many more.

- Client Side Caching
Browsers can cache some of the resources which reduces the calls to the server and improves the latency.

- Server Side Optimisations
Server side optimisations such as preload / prepush upon ML algorithm, less disk I/O, caching, efficient algorithms, smart database layer & asynchronous programming can help in optimising the latency.

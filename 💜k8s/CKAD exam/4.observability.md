Check 1: Create Nginx Pod with Liveness HTTP Get Probe
Create a new Pod named nginx in the ca1 namespace using the nginx image. Ensure that the pod listens on port 80 and configure it with a Liveness HTTP GET probe with the following configuration:

Probe Type: httpGet
Path: /
Port: 80
Initial delay seconds: 10
Polling period seconds: 5

```bash
k run nginx --namespace=ca1 --image=nginx --port=80 --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx.yaml

k create -f nginx.yaml

```

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /
        port: 80
      initialDelaySeconds: 10
      periodSeconds: 5
```


Check 2: Hosting Service Not Working
A Service in the hosting Namespace is not responding to requests. Determine which Service is not working and resolve the underlying issue so the Service begins responding to requests.

```bash
k get endpoints
# The web2 Service has no endpoints which means it cannot serve any requests. The selector for web2 is app=web2. List all of the corresponding Pods with:

k  describe pods --selector app=web2
# see that readiness probe failed

# update readiness http port to correct port
k edit deployment web2 
```



Check 3: Pod Log Analysis
The ca2 namespace contains a set of pods. Pods labelled with app=test, or app=prod have been designed to log out a static list of numbers. Run a command that combines the pod logs for all pods that have the label app=prod and then get a total row count for the combined logs and save this result out to the file /home/ubuntu/combined-row-count-prod.txt.


```bash
# Solution commands
kubectl logs -n ca2 -l app=prod | wc -l > /home/ubuntu/combined-row-count-prod.txt

# -l: with label app=prod
# wc -l: command to get a row count 
```



Check 4: Pod Diagnostics
A pod named skynet has been deployed into the ca2 namespace. This pod has the following file /skynet/t2-specs.txt located within it, containing important information. You need to extract this file and save it to the following location /home/ubuntu/t2-specs.txt.


```bash
# kubectl cp command to copy a file from a Pod to your local machine
k cp ca2/skynet:skynet/t2-specs.txt t2-specs.txt

## solution
kubectl exec -n ca2 skynet -- cat /skynet/t2-specs.txt > /home/ubuntu/t2-specs.txt
```

Check 5: Pod CPU Utilization
Find the Pod that has the highest CPU utilization in the matrix namespace. Write the name of this pod into the following file: /home/ubuntu/max-cpu-podname.txt


```bash

ubuntu@ip-10-0-128-5:~$ k top pods 
# NAME      CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)   
# agent1    983m         0Mi             
# agent10   0m           0Mi             
# agent2    0m           0Mi             
# agent3    0m           0Mi             
# agent4    0m           0Mi             
# agent5    0m           0Mi             
# agent6    0m           0Mi             
# agent7    0m           0Mi             
# agent8    0m           0Mi             
# agent9    0m           0Mi             
ubuntu@ip-10-0-128-5:~$ echo "agent1" >  /home/ubuntu/max-cpu-podname.txt


## solution
# Solution commands
kubectl top pods -n matrix --sort-by=cpu --no-headers=true | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f1 > /home/ubuntu/max-cpu-podname.txt

# head -n1: This command outputs the first n lines of a file or command output. In this case, it is used to output only the first line.

# cut -d" " -f1: This command is used to extract specific **fields** from each line of a file or command output. Here, it is set to use a space (" ") as the delimiter (-d option), and it extracts the first field (-f1 option), which essentially gives you the first word.

```

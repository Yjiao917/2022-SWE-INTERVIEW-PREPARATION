1. Show them that you stay calm and that you try to understand the other person’s perspective
Disagreements happen; it’s just a normal part of being in a workplace with other people. But the interviewer wants to see that you don’t make the situation worse when it does happen.

You’ll see this in the example answers above – the sample responses we covered are designed to show employers that as soon as you recognize a conflict has occurred, you try to understand the other person’s perspective, act logically and reasonably, and deal with the conflict quickly before it becomes worse. Show an ability to compromise and an ability to stay clear-headed when you deal with conflict, and you’ll get more job offers.



2. Show them that you think logically and don’t take things personally or get too emotional
This is true when answering, “how do you make important decisions?” also. Employers want someone who will act reasonably and look at the information available so they can make the best decision based on logic and reason.

So show them that you use facts and logic to decide what to do. This will make them feel that you’re predictable and won’t act impulsively, which can be dangerous for a company (and can scare them away from hiring you). 

3. Show them that you keep the company’s best interests in mind
You can see this in the first example from earlier in the article. The situation was that you and another sales associate were both chasing after the same lead (and trying to earn a commission from “closing” that lead and turning them into a client).

The WORST thing you could say here is that you lost the lead or didn’t end up succeeding in bringing them in as a client because of the internal conflict. So, you always want to share a story where you kept the company’s best interests in mind and took action to prevent it from becoming a bigger disagreement or problem.



example:

> “When faced with a conflict, I like to ask questions and understand my coworker’s perspective. This helps keep the situation calm, helps them feel like they’re being heard, and after this, I’ve found it’s much easier to come to an agreement or compromise while both staying a lot calmer.”

"prioritize open and respectful communication"
"listen attentively and seek clarification"
"reached a compromise that combined the best elements"
"facilitate constructive discussions where we identify the root causes of conflicts and work together to find mutually agreeable solutions."


"aim to build consensus, strengthen relationships, and maintain a positive team dynamic.”



The manager's path:

- manager's job: help employee to get things done, do what they do best
- be an enabler, a coach, and a champion

- propose other solutions, "yes, and"
- open for discussion with policy/guidance that may be neglected "help me say yes": put into production, logging, team adapt speed
- budget limit: lend authority from others to say "no"
- quick no/yes for low cost decision 


ways to communication:
- find out reason that some work is left behind, hold people accoutable
- tamming the conflict: ask other people to work on priorities and give clear explaination and expectation
- shard understanding of goals, risks, before reaching to a decision, and get execution + feedback allocated
- don't feel afraid, but be kind
- make "happy" team: psychological safety, relateness (by caring about extracurricular lives),

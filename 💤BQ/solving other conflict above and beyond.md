“If I noticed a team member displaying aggression or arrogance towards others, I would address the issue promptly and privately. I would approach the individual with empathy and express my concerns about their behavior, highlighting the impact it has on the team and work environment. I would encourage open dialogue, allowing them to share their perspective while emphasizing the importance of respect and collaboration within the team. By offering constructive feedback and suggesting alternative ways of interacting, I aim to foster a more inclusive and supportive team dynamic.”
